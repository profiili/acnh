# My ACNH 'wiki'
This is where I store my Animal Crossing: New Horizons-related stuff, including free items to give away as well as lists to keep track of (e.g. donated art).

# Free stuff
That's what you're here for, right? **Update: Since the home storage limit was increased I no longer need to get rid of stuff. Thanks for being a part of this project!**

Fossils are intended for players who may be missing just one or few fossils. Simply put: **If you don't have it, you can have it. Fossils are not for resale**.
